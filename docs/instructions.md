# Species Distribution Modeling

## Instructions

This document includes instructions for running species distribution modeling 
analyses and creating graphics. If you encounter problems, there are 
troubleshooting tips available on the [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) 
page.

### Installations

1. Install [R](http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)
2. Install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)
3. Install [Git](https://git-scm.org/downloads) **and** look at the Git section 
of the [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#git) page.

*Aside: [What's the difference between R/RStudio & Git/GitHub, anyway?](#git-vs-github)*

### Setup

1. Open RStudio and clone the Git repository at [https://github.com/jcoliver/biodiversity-sdm-lesson.git](https://github.com/jcoliver/biodiversity-sdm-lesson.git). 
If you're not sure how to do this, take a look at point #3 "Cloning a 
repository" in the Git section of the [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#git) 
document.
2. Run the setup script in RStudio by running this command in the **Console** 
tab of RStudio:
```
source(file = "scripts/setup.R")
```
This script may take a while to run, depending on the speed of your machine and 
internet connection. Note also that it may ask you if you want to restart R 
before installing/upgrading packages; if you receive this prompt, answer 
**Yes** to restarting R. This script installs additional R packages necessary 
for analyses, makes sure the `data` folder exists, and downloads climate data 
necessary to run the species distribution models. If you are prompted to choose 
a CRAN mirror, select the mirror that is geographically closest to you. If this 
script fails (or produces errors), see point #3 in the R section of the 
[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#r) page.
  
### Downloading iNaturalist data

1. You will need to download occurrence data for both butterfly and one of its 
host plants. To do so, go to iNaturalist and search for one of the two species.
2. Click on the **Filters** button to the right of the search bar near the top 
of the screen. Here you can change the filters to sort your observations to 
only include verifiable or research grade (note these will affect the number of 
observations you have to work with). Be sure to record any filters you place on 
your search.
3. Click the **Download** button in the lower right hand area of this pop up 
window. This will bring you to a new screen with many different options. At the 
very least you should see the species you searched for in the **Taxon** box 
about 1/3 of the way down the screen. Scroll through this page and select the 
options you would like. Importantly, the more options you choose in 
**3. Choose Columns**, the longer it will take to download your data. You 
should look carefully and think about the data that might be useful to you when 
considering your results. At the very least, you *must* have the **latitude** 
and **longitude** columns checked as these are necessary for generating maps in 
the next part of the project.
4. Once you have made your selections, click **Create export**. This may take a 
few minutes depending on how much data you downloaded.
5. Save the file as a csv file in the data folder within the 
biodiversity-sdm-lesson folder you downloaded from Git through RStudio. 
Rename the file "<genus_species>_data.csv" (replace <genus_species> with the 
appropriate names; for example, if you downloaded data for 
*Papilio cresphontes*, the file should be called 
"Papilio_cresphontes_data.csv""). Note: there can be no spaces in your file 
names - use an underscore ("_") any place you would otherwise want to put a 
space.
6. Repeat for the second species of interest. For example, if we download data 
for *Zanthoxylum americanum* (a host plant of *P. cresphontes*), save the file 
as "Zanthoxylum_americanum_data.csv".
  
### Running analyses

#### Single species models, current climate data

1. In the scripts directory, copy the file run-sdm-single.R and rename the 
copy "<species>-sdm-single.R", replacing "<species>" with the name of the 
butterfly species. Use underscores instead of spaces; so for the species 
*Papilio cresphontes*, the file name would be 
"Papilio_cresphontes-sdm-single.R".
2. Open this new file and update the following values:
    1. `butterfly.data.file <- "data/BUTTERFLY_DATA.csv"`
    Change `"BUTTERFLY_DATA.csv"` so it matches the file of butterfly data you 
    saved in [Setup](#setup), step 3. For example, if we are analyzing the 
    *P. cresphontes* data, this line becomes:
    `butterfly.data.file <- "data/Papilio_cresphontes_data.csv"`
    2. `outprefix <- "MY_SPECIES"` 
    Replace `"MY_SPECIES"` with the name of the butterfly species. Use 
    underscores instead of spaces; so for the species *P. cresphontes*, the 
    line would read: 
    `outprefix <- "Papilio_cresphontes"`
    3. Save the file with these updates
3. Run the analyses by typing the following command in the **Console** tab of 
RStudio: `source(file = "scripts/<species>-sdm-single.R")`, replacing 
`<species>` with the species name as in step 1 of 
[Running analyses](#running-analyses). For the *P. cresphontes* analysis, we 
would thus type the command: 
`source(file = "scripts/Papilio_cresphontes-sdm-single.R"`. After running this 
script, a map will be saved in the output folder; the file name will start 
with the value you used for "MY_SPECIES" in step 2.3, above, and end with 
"-single-prediction.pdf". So for the example *P. cresphontes*, the output pdf 
file will be at "output/Papilio_cresphontes-single-prediction.pdf".

#### Pairwise species (butterfly & plant) models, current climate data

1. In the scripts directory, copy the file run-sdm-pairwise.R and rename 
the copy "<species>-sdm-pairwise.R", replacing "<species>" with the name of the 
butterfly species. Use underscores instead of spaces; so for the species 
*Papilio cresphontes*, the file name would be 
"Papilio_cresphontes-sdm-pairwise.R".
2. Open this new file and update the following values:
    1. `butterfly.data.file <- "data/BUTTERFLY_DATA.csv"`
    Change `"BUTTERFLY_DATA.csv"` so it matches the file of butterfly data you 
    saved in [Setup](#setup), step 3. For example, if we are analyzing the 
    *P. cresphontes* data, this line becomes:
    `butterfly.data.file <- "data/Papilio_cresphontes_data.csv"`
    2. `plant.data.file <- "data/PLANT_DATA.csv"`
    Change `"PLANT_DATA.csv"` so it matches the file of plant data you saved in 
    [Setup](#setup), step 4. For example, if we are using _Z. americanum_ as 
    *P. cresphontes*' host species, this line becomes:
    `plant.data.file <- "data/Zanthoxylum_americanum_data.csv"`
    3. `outprefix <- "MY_SPECIES"` 
    Replace `"MY_SPECIES"` with the name of the butterfly species. Use 
    underscores instead of spaces; so for the species *P. cresphontes*, the 
    line would read: 
    `outprefix <- "Papilio_cresphontes"`
    4. Save the file with these updates
3. Run the analyses by typing the following command in the **Console** tab of 
RStudio: `source(file = "scripts/<species>-sdm-pairwise.R")`, replacing 
`<species>` with the species name as in step 1 of 
[Running analyses](#running-analyses). For the *P. cresphontes* analysis, we 
would thus type the command: 
`source(file = "scripts/Papilio_cresphontes-sdm-pairwise.R"`. After running 
this script, two things to note:
    1. In the console you should see the % of the modeled plant's range that is 
    occupied by the insect. Comparing this to the map, the value is the 
    fraction of the area that is red, relative to the total red and green 
    areas.
    2. A map will be saved in the `output` folder; the file name will start 
    with the value you used for "MY_SPECIES" in step 2.3, above, and end with 
    "-pairwise-prediction.pdf". So for the example *P. cresphontes*, the output 
    pdf file will be at "output/Papilio_cresphontes-pairwise-prediction.pdf".

#### Single species models, forecast climate data
1. In the scripts directory, copy the file run-future-sdm-single.R and 
rename the copy "<species>-future-sdm-single.R", replacing "<species>" with the 
name of the butterfly species. Use underscores instead of spaces; so for the 
species *Papilio cresphontes*, the file name would be 
"Papilio_cresphontes-future-sdm-single.R".
2. Open this new file and update the following values:
    1. `butterfly.data.file <- "data/BUTTERFLY_DATA.csv"`
    Change `"BUTTERFLY_DATA.csv"` so it matches the file of butterfly data you 
    saved in [Setup](#setup), step 3. For example, if we are analyzing the 
    *P. cresphontes* data, this line becomes:
    `butterfly.data.file <- "data/Papilio_cresphontes_data.csv"`
    2. `outprefix <- "MY_SPECIES"` 
    Replace `"MY_SPECIES"` with the name of the butterfly species. Use 
    underscores instead of spaces; so for the species *P. cresphontes*, the 
    line would read: 
    `outprefix <- "Papilio_cresphontes"`
    3. Save the file with these updates
3. Run the analyses by typing the following command in the **Console** tab of 
RStudio: `source(file = "scripts/<species>-future-sdm-single.R")`, replacing 
`<species>` with the species name as in step 1 of

would thus type the command: 
`source(file = "scripts/Papilio_cresphontes-future-sdm-single.R"`. After 
running this script, a map will be saved in the `output` folder; the file name 
will start with the value you used for "MY_SPECIES" in step 2.3, above, and end 
with "-single-future-prediction.pdf". So for the example *P. cresphontes*, the 
output pdf file will be at 
"output/Papilio_cresphontes-single-future-prediction.pdf".

### Git vs GitHub

So what's all this talk of Git and GitHub? How are they different? Aren't they 
just the same thing? And what about R and RStudio? Do I need both of them for 
this stuff to work?

+ **Git vs GitHub**: In short, *Git* is a piece of software that keeps track of 
versions, much like the "Track changes" option for your favorite word 
processing program. *GitHub* is a website. That's it. Well, it's a website that 
has Git running in the background and allows you to collaborate with other 
folks. There are other websites like GitHub that also use Git, including 
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com), but 
the R code for this project all lives on GitHub. In this project, Git is how 
your computer talks with the code that is stored on GitHub. And RStudio makes 
that communication that much easier...
+ **R vs RStudio**: *R* is a programming language that we use to analyze data 
and produce graphics. *RStudio* is a piece of software that we use to interact 
with R. You don't actually need RStudio to run the analyses and produce the 
maps described above. However, the RStudio program *does* make it much easier 
to interact with GitHub. It is also a nicer experience than working directly 
with the R programming language, especially for those with little to no 
programming experience.
